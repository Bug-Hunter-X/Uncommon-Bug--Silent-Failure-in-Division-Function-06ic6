# Uncommon Bug: Silent Failure in Division Function

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in a Python function. The function is supposed to return the result of dividing two numbers. However, when both input numbers are zero, it silently returns 0 instead of raising a ZeroDivisionError. This behavior can be problematic because it can mask errors and lead to unexpected results.
